My first repo on GitHub
this is my first file and I started doing some new stuff.

On october 6th, 2015, I opened an account on Codecademy and decided to start with a HTML+CSS course.
I finished that course a couple days later.
Today, I installed Ruby, Rails, setup a Git, Github, Node.JS, Heroku account.
I am following the steps of the Odin Project to get things started.
